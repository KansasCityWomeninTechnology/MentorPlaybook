# After the Session

---

After the session, we ask for your feedback on how everything went. We truly consider everything we hear and use suggestions to make sure our sessions get better and better! We also encourage you to participate on Slack. It allows our attendees to continue to confidently learn while feeling continually supported.

Also, please know we're always available if you need to speak with us about anything! This playbook is continually evolving for the better, as are our programs, and we're thrilled to have you as a part of the journey! If you need to chat, catch us in person or send us an email at [mentors@kcwomenintech.org](mailto:mentors@kcwomenintech.org).
