# Online Mentoring

---

## Tips
* Prepare like you would for in-person mentoring. Make sure to go over the content
the mentee is going to be working on.
* Introduce yourself! Send a message on the slack channel or do a quick video
meeting introducing yourself to your mentees. This is a great way to become
familiar and comfortable around each other.
* Send check in messages. It is difficult to see if someone is struggling
with their work while online mentoring, so it's a good idea to check in and
make sure everything is going smoothly.
* Encourage screen share and video meetings. If a mentee needs help it's helpful to facilitate
discussion through slack video meetings and screen share. Discourage the use of
workspace sharing extensions such as CodeTogether and LiveShare, so the mentee can
navigate the screen themselves.
* Be accessible. Work to be available to respond quickly to any questions that arise.
It is perfectly fine to step away from your computer and take a break,
but make sure to inform your mentees if you are stepping away for a while. If you need
to step away from your device for an extended period of time make sure to have another
mentor cover for you!
* Schedule sync up times. Allow sufficient time for mentees to work independently,
and schedule a time for a video meeting where all mentees can discuss their status
and work through problems together.
